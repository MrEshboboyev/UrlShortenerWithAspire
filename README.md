# UrlShortenerWithAspire

**UrlShortenerWithAspire** is a modern, high-performance web API that transforms long, cumbersome URLs into sleek, shareable short codes. This project combines the power of cutting-edge tools and frameworks to deliver an efficient, scalable, and robust URL-shortening service.

## ‚ú® Features

- **URL Shortening**: Convert long URLs into short, manageable links.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle high volumes of requests using Redis caching and PostgreSQL.
- **Performance**: Optimized database interactions with Dapper ORM.
- **Observability**: Includes advanced logging and tracing with Open Telemetry.
- **Resiliency**: Implements robust error handling and monitoring to ensure reliability.
- **Developer Friendly**: Clean architecture with easy-to-extend modularity.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core**: The backbone of the API.
- **PostgreSQL**: For robust and scalable data storage.
- **Redis**: Caching layer to improve performance.
- **Dapper**: Lightweight ORM for efficient database access.
- **Aspire**: Ensures modularity and clear service separation.
- **Open Telemetry**: For tracing and monitoring requests.
- **Logger**: Comprehensive logging to track API performance and errors.
